# perl scripts

A collection of some perl scripts written as a part of my perl learning/practicing initiatives. These may contain standalone scripts or may contain web based sample applications.

* id3-tags-manipulation/ - Sample scripts demonstrating the ID3 tag manipulation in an MP3 file using a perl program. A detailed explanation may be found on my blog [here](http://ajitabhpandey.info/2014/08/build-an-mp3-catalogue-system-with-perl-basics/) and [here](https://ajitabhpandey.info/2015/01/build-an-mp3-catalogue-system-with-perl-conclusion/)
