# python scripts which works only in [CodeSkulptor](http://codeskulptor.org)

I developed these scripts as a part of my Coursera python course. These are dependent on some modules such as simplegui which only works in CodeSkulptor](http://codeskulptor.org).

* guess_number.py - A simple number guessing game. User can choose the secret number range using the buttons.
